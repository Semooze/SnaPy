### Testing
We use the PyTest framework for unit testing our code, these tests are automatically run by Travis CI when the code is merged, code must pass these tests to be accepted.<br>
If you make changes that break these tests you will need to update the tests, if you have added new functionality consider writing unit tests for it.

### Pull Requests
We will really appreciate it if you list all the changes you have made.<br>
Please also limit your commits to one commit per feature or major change.

### Code Conventions
We try to stay true to the PEP8 Python style guide.<br>
We also use Google style docstrings.
